Version 1.5.0 -- April 15, 2020
===============================

 - Added support for fpcalc -raw -signed, which helps with easier PostgreSQL integration
 - Added support for using libavresample instead of libswresample
 - Fixed possible crash in chromaprint_decode_fingerprint
 - Fixed unit tests on big endian CPUs

Version 1.4.3 -- January 21, 2018
==================================

 - Allow one packet to have decoding error
 - Print output even if there is a decoding error, exit with error code 3 instead of 2 in such case
 - Add new option -ignore-errors to change the error code 3 to 0
 - Add new option -algorithm NUM
 - Periotically flush output when working on a stream

Version 1.4.2 -- December 28, 2016
==================================

 - Fixed invalid memory access when decoding base64-encoded fingerprints.
 - Removed unnecessary library dependencies libchromaprint to avoid circular dependency problems with FFmpeg.

Version 1.4.1 -- December 12, 2016
==================================

 - Restored the -v/-version parameter for fpcalc that got accidentally removed in 1.4.
 - Fixed processing of some short audio files. They were ignored in 1.4.
 - The DURATION field in the default output of fpcalc is now printed as an integer again.
 - Added missing version number to libchromaprint.pc.
 - Mac OS X fpcalc builds are done with clang/libc++ and should work on 10.7+.
 - Linux fpcalc builds are now fully static.

Version 1.4 -- December 3, 2016
===============================

 - Fully streaming audio processing without any post-processing step for the fingerprint generation.
 - Many performance optimizations. Especially when processing long streams, operations should be faster and use less memory.
 - C++11 compiler is now required for building the library.
 - The public C API now uses standard fixed-size int types from stdint.h (breaks backwards compatibility).
 - All code written for the library is now distributed under the MIT license.
 - Kiss FFT is now included with the library and automatically used if no other FFT library is found.
 - Added support for using the FFTW3F version of FFTW3.
 - Boost is no longer used.

Version 1.3.2 -- July 9, 2016
=============================

 - Fixed crash on an invalid audio file that FFmpeg could not decode.
 - Fixed build on Ubuntu 14.04 with libav.

Version 1.3.1 -- February 10, 2016
==================================

 - Fixed `fpcalc -length` to actually restrict fingerprints the requested length.
 - Fixed SONAME version for the shared library.

Version 1.3 -- February 2, 2016
===============================

 - You can use use "-length 0" in fpcalc to get the full fingerprint
 - New function chromaprint_get_fingerprint_hash for calculating
   SimHash from the fingerprint data
 - Added info section to the fpcalc executable on Mac OS X
 - Generate .pc (pkg-config) file on Mac OS X when not building a framework
 - Removed use of some long deprecated FFmpeg APIs
 - Some smaller bug fixes

Version 1.2 -- August 26, 2014
==============================

 - Fixed compilation with neither libswresample nor libavresample (#11)
 - Fixed compilation with static libav (#10)
 - Functions chromaprint_encode_fingerprint and chromaprint_decode_fingerprint
   are changed to accept const pointer as input
 - Added support for using the Kiss FFT library (should make Android port easier)
 - Removed obsolete dev tools from the package
 - More compatible DEBUG() macro

Version 1.1 -- November 23, 2013
================================

 - Fixed potential DoS attack in fingerprint decompression code. (#6)
 - Fixed invalid memory read with some fingerprinter configurations. (#5)
 - Fixed compilation with clang on OS X 10.9 (#7, #9)
 - Added support for audio format conversion with libav. (#2, Gordon Pettey)

Version 1.0 -- September 7, 2013
================================

 - Support for the latest FFmpeg API.
 - Support for reading audio from stdin in fpcalc.
 - Changed fpcalc to return non-zero status on failure.

Version 0.7 -- September 5, 2012
================================

 - Support for the latest FFmpeg API.
 - New (non-default) fingerprint algorithm that removes leading silence.
 - API to configure fingerprint algorithms, currently only used by
   CHROMAPRINT_ALGORITHM_TEST4.

Version 0.6 -- December 22, 2011
================================

 - Support for 24-bit file formats in fpcalc.
 - The fpcalc utility now uses 120 seconds of audio data by default.
 - Python bindings moved to a separate project (pyacoustid).

Version 0.5 -- October 6, 2011
==============================

 - Unicode command line handling in fpcalc.
 - Fixed a crash in fpcalc when FFmpeg was not able to identify the codec.
 - Added encode_fingerprint to the Python bindings.

Version 0.4 -- May 14, 2011
===========================

 - Support for building a Mac OS X framework.
 - Support for building a static library.
 - Simple C example (fpcalc) that can be used from external applications for
   fingerprint calculations.

Version 0.3 -- April 26, 2011
=============================

 - Fixed compilation with MSVC 2010.
 - Added support for calculating FFT using the Accelerate framework on
   Mac OS X and iOS.
 - Added Python bindings.

Version 0.2 -- January 26, 2011
===============================

 - New public functions chromaprint_{encode,decode}_fingerprint to
   encoding/decoding raw fingerprints.
 - New public function chromaprint_dealloc that should be used for
   releasing all memory allocated in Chromaprint functions.
