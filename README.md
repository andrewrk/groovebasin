# Groove Basin

Music player server with a web-based user interface inspired by Amarok 1.4.

Run it on a server (such as a 512MB
[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)) connected to some speakers
in your home or office. Guests can control the music player by connecting
with a laptop, tablet, or smart phone. Further, you can stream your music
library remotely.

Groove Basin works with your personal music library; not an external music
service. Groove Basin will never support DRM content.

Try out the [live demo](http://demo.groovebasin.com/).

## Features

* Fast, responsive UI. It feels like a desktop app, not a web app.

* Dynamic playlist mode which automatically queues random songs, favoring
  songs that have not been queued recently.

* Drag and drop upload. Drag and drop playlist editing. Rich keyboard
  shortcuts.

* Lazy multi-core
  [EBU R128 loudness scanning](http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness) (tags compatible
  with [ReplayGain](http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=ReplayGain_1.0_specification))
  and automatic switching between track and album mode.
  ["Loudness Zen"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuEtQqC-Sqo)

* Streaming support. You can listen to your music library - or share it with
  your friends - even when you are not physically near your home speakers.

* MPD protocol support. This means you already have a selection of
  [clients](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients) which integrate with Groove Basin.
  For example [MPDroid](https://github.com/abarisain/dmix).

* [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) scrobbling.

* File system monitoring. Add songs anywhere inside your music directory and
  they instantly appear in your library in real time.

* Supports GrooveBasin Protocol on the same port as MPD Protocol - use the
  `protocolupgrade` command to upgrade.

## Install

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) v0.10.x. Note that on Debian and
   Ubuntu, sadly the official node package is not sufficient. You will either
   have to use [Chris Lea's PPA](https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/node.js/)
   or compile from source.
2. Install [libgroove](https://github.com/andrewrk/libgroove).
3. Clone the source.
4. `npm run build`
5. `npm start`

## Configuration

When Groove Basin starts it will look for `config.js` in the current directory.
If not found it creates one for you with default values.

## Developing

```
$ npm run dev
```

This will install dependencies, build generated files, and then start the
sever. It is up to you to restart it when you modify assets or server files.

## Dependencies

The `npm run build` might fail if you system does not contain the following dependencies : 

 * [g++](http://gcc.gnu.org/). On ubuntu, this is as simple as running
   ```sudo apt-get install g++```
