License
=======

Chromaprint's own source code is licensed under the MIT license, but we
include some parts of the FFmpeg library, which is licensed under the
LGPL 2.1 license.

As a whole, Chromaprint should be therefore considered to be licensed
under the LGPL 2.1 license. We are hoping to remove the included
FFmpeg code and make MIT the only license used in the project.

Note that when distributing Chromaprint in binary form, you should
also take into consideration the license of the external FFT library
that you compile Chromaprint with.
