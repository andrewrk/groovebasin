# Groove Basin

No-nonsense music client and server for your home or office.

Run it on a server connected to your main speakers. Guests can connect with
their laptops, tablets, and phones, and play and share music.

Depends on [mpd](http://musicpd.org) version 0.17+ for the backend. Some might
call this project an mpd client. (Note, version 0.17 is only available from
source as of writing this; see below instructions regarding mpd installation.)

Live demo: [groovebasin.com](http://groovebasin.com/)

## Features

* Lightning-fast, responsive UI. You can hardly tell that the music server is
  on another computer.

* Dynamic playlist mode which automatically queues random songs, favoring
  songs that have not been played recently.

* Drag and drop upload. Drag and drop playlist editing. Rich keyboard
  shortcuts.

* Streaming support. You can listen to your music library - or share it with
  your friends - even when you are not physically near your home speakers.

* Last.fm scrobbling.

## Get Started

Make sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](http://npmjs.org)
installed and [mpd](http://musicpd.org) version 0.17+ (see below) running,
then:

```
$ npm install groovebasin
$ npm start groovebasin
```

At this point, Groove Basin will issue warnings telling you what to do next.

## Mpd

Groove Basin depends on [mpd](http://musicpd.org) version 0.17+.

To compile from source, start here

```
$ git clone git://git.musicpd.org/master/mpd.git
```

and follow mpd's instructions from there.

### Configuration

* `default_permissions` - Recommended to remove `admin` so that anonymous
  users can't do nefarious things.

* `password` - Recommended to add a password for yourself to give yourself `admin` permissions.

   * `read` - allows reading the library, current playlist, and playback status.

   * `add` - allows adding songs, loading playlists, and uploading songs. 

   * `control` - allows controlling playback state and manipulating playlists.

   * `admin` - allows updating the db, killing mpd, deleting songs from the
     library, and updating song tags.

* `audio_output` - Uncomment the "httpd" one and configure the port to enable
  streaming. Recommended "vorbis" encoder for better browser support.

* `sticker_file` - Groove Basin will not run without one set.

* `gapless_mp3_playback` - "yes" recommended. <3 gapless playback.

* `volume_normalization` - "yes" recommended. Replaygain scanners are not
  implemented for all the formats that can be played back. Volume normalization
  works on all formats.

* `max_command_list_size` - "16384" recommended. You do not want mpd crashing
  when you try to remove a ton of songs from the playlist at once.

* `auto_update` - "yes" recommended. Required for uploaded songs to show up
  in your library.

## Configuring Groove Basin

See http://npmjs.org/doc/config.html#Per-Package-Config-Settings

See the "config" section of `package.json` for configuration options and
defaults.

Example:

```
$ npm config set groovebasin:mpd_conf ~/.mpd/mpd.conf
$ npm config set groovebasin:port 80
$ npm -g --groovebasin:port=80 start groovebasin
```

## Developing

Install dependencies and run mpd as described in the Get Started section.
Then, from a clean clone of the source repository:

```
$ npm run dev
```

If you want to work on the `mpd` module:

```
$ sudo npm link <path_to_mpd_module_src>
```
