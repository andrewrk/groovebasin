//! This file contains lists of enum(i32) types that match browser strings used in various contexts.
//! Since there's a finite set of strings, it's more natural to pass i32 back and forth rather than variable-sized strings.
//!
//! Some enums are scraped from a webpage as noted below.
//! This formatter command can be used to deduplicate, sort, and number enum names from stdin:
//!     python3 -c 'import sys; print("\n".join("    {} = {},".format(name, i) for i, name in enumerate(sorted(set(sys.stdin.read().split())))))'
//! Note that any Zig keywords must be @"quoted" afterward.
